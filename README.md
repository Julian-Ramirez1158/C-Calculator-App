# Calculator App
## Julian Ramirez

## Introduction


This project serves as a basic calculator console app in C#. The user is prompted to select an arithmetic operation from a graphical user interface which is invoked through the "ShowMenu()" function. The user is given the option between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The aplication then performs the desired arithmetic operation on the numbers that are input by the user, converting these inputs to integer or double data types when appropriate. The application executes this through a switch statement nested within a "do while" loop that will ask ask the user for the appropriate input while the select option is not "Exit". The technologies used in this project are Visual Studio 2019 and C#.
